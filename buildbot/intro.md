BuildBot is a Python based continuous integration tool which can be used to automate a number of tasks such as building and testing code changes. It is used for a number of interesting software such as Blender, WebKit and supposedly OpenVPN. 

Compared to other continuous integration software such as Travis CI, BuildBot comes with a few advantages and a few disadvantages. 
### Pros
1. BuildBot can be hosted internally, either locally or on a specified server. The standard travis-ci.org version of Travis CI does not support this.
2. BuildBot is free and open source. While the commonly used version of Travis CI seemingly requires you to pay if you are not doing an Open Source project.

### Cons
1. Although BuildBot's interface looks nice, it can also feel a bit clunky compared to the interface of Travis CI.
