You've started the Docker image, but where is BuildBot? Well, BuildBot is hosted in your browser (which may have become apparent with all of that URL copy and pasting in the config files). 
In turn to access the BuildBot User Interface please head over to https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8010-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/
