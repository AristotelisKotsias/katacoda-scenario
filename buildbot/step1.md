The first step to getting BuildBot running on your machine through Docker, is making sure you've got Docker installed. 
Please run  `docker --version`{{execute HOST1}}

If this does not work, please install Docker following the [appropriate installation instructions for your device](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (also useful for getting a local installation working).

This tutorial however assumes that you are running Ubuntu. Therefore you can install Docker by running `sudo apt-get update`{{execute T1}}
Followed by `sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io`{{execute HOST1}}
