You've started the Docker image, but where is BuildBot? Well, BuildBot is hosted in your browser (which may have become apparent with all of that URL copy and pasting in the config files). 
In turn to access the BuildBot User Interface please head over to https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8010-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

After that, to ensure that BuildBot is functioning properly please head over to the Builds tab to the left. Then in the Builds tab, please click the Builders tab.

Then go right ahead, click on the "runtests" builder. After that force a build, by clicking the blue "force" button in the top right corner. Then "Start Build", there is no need to input any information.
